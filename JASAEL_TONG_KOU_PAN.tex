\begin{abstract}
The modal description of closed acoustical systems such as rooms and
enclosure is well known and is commonly used to find the forced response
at a given frequency as the superposition of the eigenmodes. Not much
literature, however, exists on calculating the forced reponse using
the modal description of sound radiated from open cavities, despite
their significant practical importance. Taking a baffled rectangular
open cavity as an example, it is provided in the present paper a solid
theoretical formulation and corresponding numerical verification to
show that, the forced response of such an open cavity system can be
expressed via superposition of bi-orthogonal frequency-dependent eigenmodes.\footnote{testfootnote}
