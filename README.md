# Sound propagation in 3D open cavity

This folder contains the source code and study results relevant to the investigation of sound propagation in 3D open cavities. 

In this study, I managed to decompose the sound field WITHIN an open cavity (note only the cavity part of the open cavity) using a set of bi-orthogonal modes. The method was inspired by the Feshbach projection formalism in atomic physics.

The manuscript included in the folder was later published on *Wave Motion* (2017).
